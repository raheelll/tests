Promotions will be available in Kounta after the successful CBA test 
1.	We received webhook from Kounta as per how we do it today
2.	We run GET PROMOTIONS FOR A SITE GET /v1/cba/sites/123/promotions.json to get both active and inactive promotions
3.	We run GET ACTIVE PROMOTIONS FOR A SITE GET /v1/cba/sites/123.json to get the promotion ids for the active promotions, we always select the first one returned
4.	Using the promotion_id obtained from step 3, we extract the active promotion from the list of promotions obtained in step 2 and place it in Firebase

There are two types of Promotions: Upsell and Discount. 

Upsell promotion contains both ‘Triggers’ and ‘Apply’ sections of API. Upsell is triggered by the event (e.g. customer buys coffee and gets the discounted muffin)

Discount promotion only contains the ‘Apply’ section of API

Discount: 
Trigger: always
Redemption: PERCENT ONLY
- on multiple categories
- on multiple products
- on whole order
Upsell: 
Trigger: ONLY USE QTY
- on multiple categories
- on multiple products
Redemption: PERCENT or DOLLAR OFF
- single product
- single category

CBA only supports Product Ids and Category Ids
‘customer_ids’, ‘customer_tags’, ‘customer_linked’, "product_tags” are not supported by CBA
